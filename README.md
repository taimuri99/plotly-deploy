# Module 12 JS, HTML and JSON Data: Plotly &amp; Belly Button Biodiversity
Challenge 12 focused on building an interactive webpage with sample demographic data and visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer whose records can be accessed by Volunteer ID number. The top ten bacterial cultures are included as a bar chart while the rest of the bacterial cultures per sample are plotted as a bubble plot. A graphic is also shown for frequency of hand washing for each volunteer. The data and plots automatically update with choosing a different ID number.
